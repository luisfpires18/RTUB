## 🎵 About

RTUB (Real Tuna Universitária de Bragança) is a comprehensive web platform built with **Blazor** that serves as the digital hub for the university's traditional tuna music group. This interactive application provides tools for managing members, events, performances, repertoire, rehearsals, inventory, and financial operations while engaging with the community through a modern, responsive interface.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a **Clean Architecture** pattern with clear separation of concerns:

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later
- Visual Studio 2022 / Visual Studio Code / Rider
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luisfpires18/RTUB.git
cd RTUB
```

2. **Restore NuGet packages:**
```bash
dotnet restore
```

3. **Configure the application:**
   - Copy `appsettings.Development.json.example` to `appsettings.Development.json` (if not present)
   - Update your local `appsettings.Development.json` with your development credentials
   - The file is ignored by git to keep your secrets safe

4. **Run the application:**
```bash
cd src/RTUB.Web
dotnet run
```

5. **Access the application:**
   - Navigate to `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`
   - The database will be automatically migrated and seeded on first run

### Configuration

#### Local Development

For local development, sensitive configuration values should be stored in `appsettings.Development.json` (which is git-ignored):

```json
{
  "AdminUser": {
    "Username": "your-username",
    "Email": "your-email@example.com",
    "Password": "YourPassword123!"
  },
  "EmailSettings": {
    "SmtpServer": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "SmtpPort": 587,
    "SmtpUsername": "your-email@gmail.com",
    "SmtpPassword": "your-gmail-app-password",
    "SenderEmail": "sender@example.com",
    "SenderName": "RTUB"
  },
  "IDrive": {
    "Endpoint": "s3.endpoint.example.com",
    "Bucket": "your-bucket",
    "AccessKey": "your-access-key",
    "SecretKey": "your-secret-key"
  }
}
```

**Note:** For Gmail SMTP, use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) (not your regular Gmail password). Generate one in your Google Account settings under Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords.

#### Production Deployment

For production, **do not include credentials in JSON files**. Instead, use environment variables:

**SMTP Configuration:**
- `EmailSettings__SmtpUsername` - SMTP username
- `EmailSettings__SmtpPassword` - SMTP password (for Gmail, use an App Password)
- `EmailSettings__SenderEmail` - Sender email address

**Admin User Configuration:**
- `AdminUser__Username` - Default admin username
- `AdminUser__Email` - Default admin email
- `AdminUser__Password` - Default admin password

**IDrive/S3 Configuration:**
- `IDrive__AccessKey` - S3-compatible storage access key
- `IDrive__SecretKey` - S3-compatible storage secret key
- `IDrive__Endpoint` - S3-compatible storage endpoint
- `IDrive__Bucket` - Storage bucket name

The configuration system follows the standard ASP.NET Core hierarchy (from lowest to highest priority):
1. `appsettings.json` (base settings)
2. `appsettings.{Environment}.json` (environment-specific overrides)
3. Environment variables (overrides all JSON settings)

### Default Configuration

The application uses SQLite by default with connection string:
```
Data Source=app.db
```

The database is automatically:
- Created on first run
- Migrated to the latest schema
- Seeded with initial data

## 💻 Development

### Building the Solution

```bash
# Build all projects
dotnet build

# Build in Release mode
dotnet build -c Release

# Build specific project
dotnet build src/RTUB.Web
```

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
cd src/RTUB.Web
dotnet watch run
```

This enables hot reload for Blazor components and C# code during development.

### Development Features

- **Detailed Errors**: Enabled in development mode
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic UI updates on code changes
- **SignalR Debugging**: Detailed SignalR errors in development
- **HTTPS Redirection**: Automatically configured

### Code Style

The project follows standard C# coding conventions:
- PascalCase for public members
- camelCase for private fields
- Async suffix for asynchronous methods
- XML documentation for public APIs
- Clean code principles

## 🧪 Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
dotnet test
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true
```

Run specific test project:
```bash
dotnet test tests/[YourTestProject]
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Azure Deployment

The project includes Azure deployment configuration (`.deployment` file).

#### Prerequisites
- Azure App Service
- SQL Server or continue using SQLite

#### Deployment Steps

1. **Publish the application:**
```bash
dotnet publish src/RTUB.Web -c Release -o ./publish
```

2. **Configure Azure App Service:**
   - Set connection strings in Configuration
   - Configure environment variables
   - Enable HTTPS only

3. **Deploy:**
   - Use Azure CLI, GitHub Actions, or Visual Studio publish
   - The application will auto-migrate the database on startup

### Production Configuration

Update `appsettings.Production.json`:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "SqliteConnection": "Data Source=/path/to/production/app.db"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

The application includes:
- **Response Compression** (Brotli/Gzip)
- **Response Caching** for static files (30 days in production)
- **Memory Caching** for frequently accessed data
- **SignalR optimization** for Blazor Interactive Server
- **Static file caching** with cache headers
